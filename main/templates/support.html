	<div class="explanation">
	<p>Form authoring in formhub is based on the XLSForm standard. While there is an initial learning curve, we’ve found that XLS provides a great interface for authoring forms — whether it’s simple 5 question questionnaire or a complex survey with hundreds of questions. XLS also makes sharing and collaborating on forms easy. Whether you need help authoring your first form or want to pick up advanced tips,  please check out our <a href = "http://formhub.org/syntax"> XLForm Syntax page </a> and our gallery of sample forms on <a href ="http://formhub.org/formhub_u/">formhub University</a>. </p>
