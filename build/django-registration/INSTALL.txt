Thanks for downloading django-registration.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

If you have the Python ``easy_install`` utility available, you can
also type the following to download and install in one step::

   easy_install django-registration

Or if you're using ``pip``::

    pip install django-registration

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``registration``
directory somewhere on your Python path, or symlink to it from
somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a
Mercurial checkout.

Note that this application requires Python 2.3 or later, and a
functional installation of Django 1.0 or newer. You can obtain Python
from http://www.python.org/ and Django from
http://www.djangoproject.com/.
