`Adrian Holovaty`_
    Adrian is a Web developer with a background in journalism. He's known in
    journalism circles as one of the pioneers of "journalism via computer
    programming", and in technical circles as "the guy who invented Django."

    He was lead developer at World Online for 2.5 years, during which time
    Django was developed and implemented on World Online's sites. He's now the
    leader and founder of EveryBlock_, a "news feed for your block".

    Adrian lives in Chicago, USA.

`Simon Willison`_
    Simon is a well-respected Web developer from England. He had a one-year
    internship at World Online, during which time he and Adrian developed Django
    from scratch. The most enthusiastic Brit you'll ever meet, he's passionate
    about best practices in Web development and maintains a well-read
    `web-development blog`_.

    Simon lives in Brighton, England.

`Jacob Kaplan-Moss`_
    Jacob is a partner at `Revolution Systems`_ which provides support services
    around Django and related open source technologies. A good deal of Jacob's

    Online, where Django was invented, where he was the lead developer of
    Ellington, a commercial Web publishing platform for media companies.

    Jacob lives in Lawrence, Kansas, USA.

Current developers

Currently, Django is led by a team of volunteers from around the globe.

BDFLs
-----

Adrian and Jacob are the Co-`Benevolent Dictators for Life`_ of Django. When
"rough consensus and working code" fails, they're the ones who make the tough
decisions.

Core developers
---------------

These are the folks who have a long history of contributions, a solid track
record of being helpful on the mailing lists, and a proven desire to dedicate
serious time to Django. In return, they've been granted the coveted commit bit,
and have free rein to hack on all parts of Django.

`Malcolm Tredinnick`_
    Malcolm originally wanted to be a mathematician, somehow ended up a software
    developer. He's contributed to many Open Source projects, has served on the
    board of the GNOME foundation, and will kick your ass at chess.

    When he's not busy being an International Man of Mystery, Malcolm lives in
    Sydney, Australia.

`Russell Keith-Magee`_
    Russell studied physics as an undergraduate, and studied neural networks for
    his PhD. His first job was with a startup in the defense industry developing
    simulation frameworks. Over time, mostly through work with Django, he's
    become more involved in Web development.

    Russell has helped with several major aspects of Django, including a
    couple major internal refactorings, creation of the test system, and more.

    Russell lives in the most isolated capital city in the world â€” Perth,
    Australia.

Joseph Kocherhans
    Joseph is currently a developer at EveryBlock_, and previously worked for
    the Lawrence Journal-World where he built most of the backend for their
    Marketplace site. He often disappears for several days into the woods,
    attempts to teach himself computational linguistics, and annoys his
    neighbors with his Charango_ playing.

    Joseph's first contribution to Django was a series of improvements to the
    authorization system leading up to support for pluggable authorization.
    Since then, he's worked on the new forms system, its use in the admin, and
    many other smaller improvements.

    Joseph lives in Chicago, USA.

    contributed to a number of Open Source projects and worked
    professionally as a developer.

    Luke has contributed many excellent improvements to Django,
    including database-level improvements, the CSRF middleware and
    many unit tests.

    Luke currently works for a church in Bradford, UK, and part-time

Karen Tracey
    Karen has a background in distributed operating systems (graduate school),
    communications software (industry) and crossword puzzle construction
    (freelance).  The last of these brought her to Django, in late 2006, when
    she set out to put a Web front-end on her crossword puzzle database.
    That done, she stuck around in the community answering questions, debugging
    problems, etc. -- because coding puzzles are as much fun as word puzzles.

    Karen lives in Apex, NC, USA.

    queryset-refactor, but not magic-removal), and works as a freelance
    developer with OddBird_ and Eldarion_. He became a Django contributor by

    to Django, learning a lot and having fun in the process.

    Ramiro lives in CÃ³rdoba, Argentina.

    better pay. He lives in Lawrence, Kansas, where he works for the
    Journal-World developing Ellington. He `keeps a blog`_, has
    written a `book on Django`_, and enjoys fine port and talking to
