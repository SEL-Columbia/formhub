The documentation in this tree is in plain text files and can be viewed using
any text file viewer.

Technically speaking, it uses ReST (reStructuredText) [1], and the Sphinx
documentation system [2].  This allows it to be built into other forms for
easier viewing and browsing.

To create an HTML version of the docs on a Unix machine (Linux or Mac):

* Install Sphinx (using ``easy_install Sphinx`` or some other method)

* In this docs/ directory, type ``make html`` at a shell prompt.

The documentation in _build/html/index.html can then be viewed in a web browser.
